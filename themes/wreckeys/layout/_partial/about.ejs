        Hey there! Thank you for checking out Wreckey's Custom
        MIDI. My name is Gaya Kessler and I create <a href="#projects">custom MIDI
            controllers</a> and other music related gear for very
        specific use cases.

    <p>
        I program, build, and assemble
        everything by hand. Everything
        except for the parts themselves is
        completely DIY.
    </p>

    <p>
        My background is in software
        development and have always had an
        interest in all things to do with
        making music.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to <a href="#contact">Get in Touch</a>
        about any of my project or you want to discuss
        some custom work.
