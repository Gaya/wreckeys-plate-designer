        Hey there! Thank you for checking out Wreckey's Custom
        MIDI. My name is Gaya Kessler and I create custom MIDI
        controllers and other music related gear for very specific
        use cases.

    <p>
        I program, build, and assemble
        everything by hand. Everything except
        for the parts themselves is completely
        DIY.
    </p>

    <p>
        My background is in development and
        have always had an interest in making
        music which evolved into this.
